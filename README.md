# :rocket:**NEWS APP**

## üëì DETAILS:
This app has been made in python using news api and pycharm for integration.  
The API used can be found on: https://newsapi.org/  
I have used concepts of GUI and OOPS in python to make the app more presentable and easy to use.  

## üìÉSTRUCTURE OF THE APP:
it consists of:  
- **IMAGE**: The image (related to the news) appears on top of the page. In case there is an error in loading the image, an alternate image indicationg the error loads up.
- **HEADING**: It states the headline of the news and can be found below the image.
- **DESCRIPTION**: After the heading is the description with a brief overview of the news.
- **BUTTONS**: Below the description are three buttons (Next,Prev,Read More) which are used as specified below:
   - ***READ MORE BUTTON***: This button is used for reading the news in more detail on the web browser.
   - ***NEXT BUTTON***: This is used for viewing the next article.
   - ***PREV BUTTON***: It is used for viewing the previous article.
